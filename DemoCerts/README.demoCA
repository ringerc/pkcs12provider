DEMO CERTS
==========


In addition, some self-signed certificates are included for testing.


DEMO CA
=======

A trivial certificate authority is included in this package for testing
purposes only. It can be found in DemoCerts/demoCA. If you use it for anything
you care about, you're insane. The whole Internet has access to your CA key and
can sign whatever they like with it.

The Demo CA was produced with OpenSSL, but other tools may be used.
Java's keytool appears to be too limited, however - it appears to
lack the ability to sign a certificate request.

Here are some much better instructions on producing a demo CA
than what I originally wrote:
