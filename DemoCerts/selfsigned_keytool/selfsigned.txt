As this is a self-signed certificate, it may only be used to authenticate to a
peer that has directly accepted this certificate as trusted for the purpose
(identifying a server or identifying a client). Most servers provide no way to
add a list of trusted client certificates, instead requiring the signing CA
cert to be provided, so you'll have a hard time using this as a client
certificate in testing. So don't.
