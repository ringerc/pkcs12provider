DemoCerts
=========

The DemoCerts directory contains a certificate authority with CA
certificate, a few sample PKCS#12 (.p12) format client certificates, a
PEM-format key and cert signed by the CA for installation in a server, etc.

See the README in the DemoCerts directory for details.

Do not under any circumstances use anything in the DemoCerts directory
for anything except totally insecure testing of things you do not care
about.
