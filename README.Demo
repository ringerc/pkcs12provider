To execute Demo.class, you will need a PKCS#12 format certificate archive, and
access to a HTTPs server that has an SSL certificate signed by one of the CAs
in that pkcs#12 archive.

None of the demo classes are included in the the pkcs12provider jar. You will
need to run a build, then execute them from the target/ directory. For the
main Demo class:

  cd target/classes
  java au/com/postnewspapers/pkcs12provider/demo/Demo https://test.server/ my_cert.p12 my_cert_pass
